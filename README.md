Developed a backend system for a Contact Management application using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. Key features include:

User Authentication: Secure registration and login system using JWT tokens, allowing only authenticated users to access their contacts.

CRUD Operations: Full Create, Read, Update, Delete functionality for managing contacts efficiently.

Secure Access: All operations are protected by JWT, ensuring users can only access their own data.

Database: Used MongoDB for flexible and scalable storage of contact information.

This backend provides a solid foundation for a full-stack contact management system, easily integrated with a frontend for a seamless user experience.
